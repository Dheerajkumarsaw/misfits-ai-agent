## Technical Implementation

### System Prompt Changes (ai_agent.py ~line 2028)
```python
📱 MOBILE-FIRST COMMUNICATION:
- **CRITICAL: Keep responses SHORT and SCANNABLE for mobile screens**
- MAX 3-4 sentences before showing events
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 per message max)
- Event descriptions: 1-2 lines each, NOT full paragraphs
- Think Twitter-length, not essay-length
```

### Event Presentation Format (line ~2139)
```python
**EVENT PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS (MOBILE-OPTIMIZED):**
7. For each event, keep it CONCISE (2-3 lines per event):
   - Line 1: Event name + emoji
   - Line 2: Date/time + Location (area only)
   - Line 3: Price + Registration link
```

### Follow-up Questions (line ~2329)
```python
def generate_follow_up_question(...):
    """Generate SHORT contextual follow-up questions for mobile screens"""
    # Returns 3-5 word questions instead of full sentences
```
